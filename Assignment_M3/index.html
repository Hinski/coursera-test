          Romance, who loves to nod and sing, 
          With drowsy head and folded wing, 
          Among the green leaves as they shake 
          Far down within some shadowy lake, 
          To me a painted paroquet 
          Hath been a most familiar bird 
          Taught me my alphabet to say
          To lisp my very earliest word 
          While in the wild wood I did lie, 
          A child—with a most knowing eye. 
          Of late, eternal Condor years 
          So shake the very Heaven on high 
          With tumult as they thunder by, 
          I have no time for idle cares
          Through gazing on the unquiet sky. 
          And when an hour with calmer wings 
          Its down upon my spirit flings— 
          That little time with lyre and rhyme 
          To while away forbidden things! 
          My heart would feel to be a crime 
          Unless it trembled with the strings.
