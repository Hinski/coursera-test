    Romance, who loves to nod and sing, 
    With drowsy head and folded wing, 
    Among the green leaves as they shake 
    Far down within some shadowy lake, 
    To me a painted paroquet 
   Hath been—a most familiar bird— 
   Taught me my alphabet to say—

    <section>
    To lisp my very earliest word 
  While in the wild wood I did lie, 
  A child—with a most knowing eye. 
  Of late, eternal Condor years 
  So shake the very Heaven on high 
  With tumult as they thunder by, 
  I have no time for idle cares

  <p>Part3</p>
  <section>
  Through gazing on the unquiet sky. 
  And when an hour with calmer wings 
  Its down upon my spirit flings— 
  That little time with lyre and rhyme 
  To while away—forbidden things! 
  My heart would feel to be a crime 
  Unless it trembled with the strings.
